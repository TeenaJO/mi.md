# MANUAL UI and MAVLINK, IMAGE TRANSFER DOCUMENTATION
## UI DOCUMENTATION
### I have created a simple user interface (UI) using buttons, simple functions, and key bindings. The UI allows users to select an image directory, preview images, and perform various actions on them.


The UI mainly is mainly controlled by 3 keys on the keyboard:-
1.`Y or y`-
* This key  when pressed will allow the drone to be controlled In the guided mode.(`guided` function performs this action).
* It also allows the user to crop out the target .Once we click on the target the cropped image appears on the canvas and the `target 1-target 5`   buttons with their  entered details will be displayed so that  when once clicked on the respective target button the bottle with fitting description is dropped(`yes` function performs this action).
* A button will also be displayed along with it which has the coordinates of the point clicked displayed on it(`getco` function performs this action).


2.`N or n`-
* This key when pressed will move to  next image in the folder.
* The images are displayed according to the sorted order.The images are sorted according to the time using `getmtime`
* The other `target` buttons will be hidden when we click this button using the `hide` function.


3.`L or l` - 
* This key when pressed will give the latest images captured by drone when it has reached the location of our desired target so as to get the exact coordinates .
* It has the same features as the `y` button-allows the drone to be controlled in the guided mode,crops the target out and gives the exact coordinates of the target.(the `latest` function performs this action)

### The functions used :-
* `set_data`-
    * Allows to enter the details of the targets 1,2,3,4 and 5 in the order **shape_color-of-the-target_character_color-of-the-character**.
    * If all the details are not entered it will thrown an error when Set button is clicked.
    * When the Next button is clicked the `class ImageDisplay` is called.
#### The functions called inside ImageDisplay class:-
2.create_widgets  -creates a canvas for the images to be displayed on it
3.get_image_paths-this function appends the files that has the required extensions to the existing folder path.
4.click_event-this function uses the image in OpenCV format to find out the coordinates of the region clicked by the user and crops the region by moving the x and y coordinates by  50 pixels in all the 4 directions. 
This function is called in the getco function later
5.show_image-this function shows the image at the current index in the Pillow format .It also converts the image to OpenCV format so that when the user click “Y” or ”y” ,the image is opened in full screen to the coordinates.
If the images in the folder are empty then,in the else part  time.sleep(1) is used so that the program stops for 1 sec and in this 1 sec the captured images arrive and the images with the required extensions are appended to the current working folder path and again show_image function .
6.getco-this function shows the OpenCV image in full screen to get the coordinates.
Creates a separate window called ‘point coordinates’ for it to be displayed.
The self.ref is 1 when L or l is pressed for the latest image and the self.ref is 0 when no or none is pressed .
7.latest-this function is used to get the latest image from the folder.
The files are sorted using getmtime and the latest image is displayed on the screen .
This function is called when ‘L’ or ‘l’ or the latest button is pressed.
This function also moves all the files to a skipped folder from the current folder.
The functions guided,getco and yes are called within this function so that when the latest function is called it the drone can be controlled in the guided mode,target buttons appear,cropping feature is enabled and the coordinates are displayed for the latest images.

8.guided- when “Y” or “y” and “L” or “l ” or the latest button is pressed,the command is given to the drone to shift to guided mode .(when we want the drone to move to a specific point on the map(above the desired target).
9.auto-This  function is used to bring the drone to the AUTO mode which is used run pre-defined waypoint missions on Copter.
10.confirm-Inside this function we are storing the x and y coordinate as x_cord and y_cord .Once we have clicked the target button we will get a confirmation message with Yes or No button .If we have clicked on Yes then the x_cord and y_cord will be passed to the automation function.
If we have clicked No  then the target buttons will disappear.
11.hide-If we have clicked No in the confirmation message,then the drone will get shifted back to the auto mode.
This function is also called who ‘n’ or ‘N’ is clicked.It basically hides the target buttons so that the user doesnot click on it accidently.
12.disable-This function is called when a target is selected.
It disables the target button so that the user doesnot accidently click on those buttons.
13.yes-this function is called when in the latest function and when y or Y is pressed.
This function displays the target details in the form of 5 buttons.It has a latest button to get the latest image from the folder and it also has a button on which the coordinates are displayed.
14.handle_keypress-checks which character is pressed on the keyboard – n or N ,y or Y ,l or L and calls the respective functions within it.
